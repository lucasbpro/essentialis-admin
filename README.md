This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Customized Scripts

In the project directory, besides some standard scripts from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), you can also run:

### `yarn develop` or `npm run develop`

Runs the app in the development mode. Concomittantly, it runs a [JSON-Server] application which mocks a Rest-API for quick or prototyping and mocking.<br />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the React app in the browser.
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to access the JSON-Server.

You might need to change the URL_API variable defined in the _index.js_ file within _services_ subfolder (located in /src folder) to match the JSON-Server address ([http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)).
